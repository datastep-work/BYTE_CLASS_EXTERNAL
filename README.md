 ByteClass – Free Data Science Classes by DataStep Learning


Welcome to **ByteClass**, a free, community-driven learning initiative by **DataStep Learning**.  
Our goal is simple: **Build Skills. Solve Problems. Gain Confidence in Data Science.**

This repository contains all the **class notebooks**, **datasets**, and **resources** from our live sessions – neatly organized by the date of each class.


## What is ByteClass?

ByteClass is designed for:
- **Beginners** taking their first step in data science  
- **Re-starters** coming back after a career break  
- **Early learners** (less than 1 year of experience) who want structured, hands-on exposure  

Each class covers practical data science concepts with Python and real-world examples.
